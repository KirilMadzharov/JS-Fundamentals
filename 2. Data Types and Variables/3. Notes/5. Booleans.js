"What is a Boolean?"

// ▪ Boolean represents a logical entity and can have two
// values: true and false
//
// ▪ You can use the Boolean() function to find out if an
//     expression (or a variable) is true:

Boolean(10 > 9) // Returns true

    (10 > 9) // Also returns true
    10 > 9 // Also returns true
